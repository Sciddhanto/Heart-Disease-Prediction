# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Logistic Regression

This is a machine learning project to predict heart disease using Python. The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.
- **Model Training**: Using various machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict heart disease on new data.

## Project Overview

### Steps Involved:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing the heart disease dataset to understand patterns and trends.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for model training by cleaning and transforming it.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and others.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Using the model to predict heart disease outcomes based on input features.

## Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
